# deep-learning-scripts-by-a-beginner
I am learning basics of deep learning using python and trying out various algoroithms.
I usually use Jupyter notebooks. 
If you using the material in this repository, i would recommend using Jupyter notebook files. They are better documented and easier to follow.
If you are looking for code to execute, I have rough patched the same code in .Py files in the same folder next to the notebooks. 
Feel free to contribute if you like :)
